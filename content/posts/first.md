So, I want to start a blog again. I'm still terrified of writing, and I want to write. 

So, a somewhat public blog, that almost no one knows about seems a good place to start!
All the better if it doesn't allow comments and is published statically so I don't have to worry about being hacked.

Practicing writing should be good, and is at least 5/7ths of the goal really.
I can work past the writers block, and the gripping fear of having my words read, and somewhat permanently committed to page.
Maybe someday I'll share them, or I'll start anew once past the fear!

For now, I'm still trying to work out how to get it to actually appear anywhere other than my own personal machine.
I'm trialing out Hugo and the [Kiera](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-kiera/) theme, and hope to host on github pages. It should be a learning experience it seems.
I imagine I've wrecked it all so far and will likely have to rip out bits and potentially start over.

I'm definitely going to have to not write on a chromebook keyboard with a stupid sensitive touchpad that keeps reading my palms.
